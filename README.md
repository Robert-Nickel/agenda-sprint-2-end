# Agenda as a website

Use this as template for your own Agenda as a website. Steps:
1. Use this as template (name it properly for the meeting) (Big green button on the top right: "Use this template")
2. Update the table in index.md to match YOUR agenda and push it to master
3. Go to Settings -> Github Pages and set Source: Branch: master (+ enable https)

You get your url from there and can send it around. You can see an example [here](https://robertnickel.online/agenda-team-1-sprint-2/).

Pros of an Agenda as a website:
 - Its an simple visualization of meeting goals within their timeframe
 - You can update it centrally, because things always take longer
 - In a remote session, everyone can just have it open on their browser
